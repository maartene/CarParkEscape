## üçÖ Pomodoro 1

üöß: Implement a car park with multiple levels and multiple stops

Cases:
‚úÖ On what floor are we?
‚úÖ In which spot are we?
‚úÖ How many spots are on a floor? How many steps to take
‚úÖ Where is the staircase? Left or right?
‚úÖ Go down the stairs
‚úÖ Are we on the ground floor?
‚úÖ Go to the exit

‚ö†Ô∏è What if the start floor is not the latest element in the array?
‚ö†Ô∏è What if we don't need to go anyway --> Empty array

How did this feel?

- Tiring
- Fingers crossed
- Refactor during implementation
- Unclear what we were working on or trying to solve
- Feels unsafe
- Difficult to understand the output, need to debug
- Difficult to refactor, unclear what breaks
- We loose oversight of the code, run in to a lot of WTF
- Unclear what cases we implemented
- We ended up adding more testcases
- Naming of the test cases was difficult
- Difficult to help as navigator
- Steps too big
- Way of programming that feels: I don't want to make this my carreer
- Mental model in your head needs to be way too big
- Lack of a _shared_ mental model between driver and navigator

## Pomodoro 2: And now we do it the right way
- ‚úÖ park right next to the exit
- ‚úÖ park on the same floor (all the way to the left), a bit away from the exit
- ‚úÖ park on the same floor (in the middle), a bit away from the exit
- ‚úÖ park on a second floor right next to the stairs
- Fixed ‚ùå in test where parking on second floor, right next to stairs should return R3.

## Pomodoro 3: Continue with going left
- ‚úÖ Need to move left two steps to reach the stairs
- ‚úÖ Refactored tests to be parameterized
- ‚úÖ Extract movement instruction from `escape` function

## Pomodoro 4: Three store garages
- ‚úÖ Three store garages
- ‚úÖ Refactor going down a stairs to also be an instruction

## Pomodoro 5: Three store garages
- ‚úÖ Going down more than once
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Codewars test cases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Instead of Directions being a string ("D", "L", "R") what if they are in domain language instead?
